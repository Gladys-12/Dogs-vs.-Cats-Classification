## Dataset

- **Training Set:** 19,998 images belonging to two classes (cats and dogs).
- **Validation Set:** 5,000 images for performance evaluation.
- **Test Set:** 12,500 unseen images for prediction and analysis.

---

## Training

The model is trained using an iterative approach with multiple epochs. Fine-tuning is performed by reducing the learning rate for enhanced accuracy. The training and validation sets are utilized to monitor model performance during training.

### Results:

- **Training Accuracy:** 99.96%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 97.56%
- **Validation Loss:** 0.1027

## Visualization

- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides insight into the modelâ€™s performance on the validation set.
- **Feature Maps:** Visualized output of individual filters in the convolution layers to understand feature extraction.
- **Misclassifications:** Examines incorrectly classified images to refine the model.

## Prediction

Single image predictions are supported, with output probabilities for each class. The classifier can predict on unseen datasets to evaluate generalizability.

---

## Performance on Unseen Data

The model demonstrates strong performance on unseen test images with predictions accompanied by probabilities for both classes. Examples of correct and misclassified images are visualized for qualitative assessment.

## Conclusion

The classifier achieves **97.56% accuracy** on the validation set, demonstrating robust performance. Further improvements can be made with deeper architectures and additional fine-tuning of hyperparameters. The trained model is available in the `resources` directory for experimentation and testing.
